This Project is the Data visualization project from the course "Data visualization & sonification".

A short video  that explains it can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C82X0sIXr4w&list=UUafOFHPCI-uMq6aWl2tmQXg&index=2

The project task was to create an app by visualizing high dimensional data.
I've used Spotify song data to create an interactive plot for playlist making.

You can try the demo (w/o the option to make playlist) here: https://toozig.shinyapps.io/idofy/
